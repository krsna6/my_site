I";<p>I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the University of Southern California (USC) <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/">Viterbi School of Engineering</a>. I am a member of Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory <a href="sail.usc.edu">(SAIL)</a> and advised by <a href="http://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.php">Prof. Shri Narayanan</a>.</p>

<p>I build robust machine intelligence models by learning from multiple views and modalities in datasets. Some application areas of my research are understanding multimedia content, computational imaging, affective computing and developing inclusive technologies.</p>

<p>At SAIL, I led the Media Informatics and Content Analysis <a href="sail.usc.edu/mica">(MICA)</a> group and helped create <a href="">The Center for Computational Media Intelligence</a> that aims to quantify diversity and inclusion and understand representation of people and understand media content.</p>

<p>Prior to USC, I worked as a research scientist at NYU Langone Medical Center (LMC), NYC after receiving my masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California at Santa Barbara. At NYU LMC, I worked on quantifying subcortical brain connectomes with functional MRI in kids with Autism.</p>
