I"*<p>Real-time MRI can help understand human speech product processes. Automatic segmentation of articulators (e.g., tongue, lips) is vital for study of vocal tract dynamics in rtMRI.<br />
The overall methodology and examples are shown below. For more details, see the <a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/~toutios/pdfs/somandepalli2017semantic.pdf">paper</a></p>

<p>Inspired by semantic segmentation work, we propose a full convolutional encoder-decoder network to predict articulatory boundaries (colored lines shown on the MRI image in Fig. 2). The model performance was further improve by adding a penalty to the loss function to peanalize heavily when articulator pixels are confused with that of air vs. tissue. This helped reinforce the tissue boundary segmentation with a higher confidence.</p>
