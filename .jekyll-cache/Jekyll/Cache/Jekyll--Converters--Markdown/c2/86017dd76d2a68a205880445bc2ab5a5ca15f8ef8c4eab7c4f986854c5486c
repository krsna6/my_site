Robust face clustering is a key step towards computational understanding of visual character portrayals in media i.e., automatically extracting "who" appears "where" statistics. A first step toward developing such tools is the ability to automatically identify the characters in the visual modality i.e., the "who". 
This is a difficult task because characters are often portrayed with varying degrees of complexity with respect to appearance and design in different media forms

What are the challenges in video content?
</b></summary>
Face recognition and clustering in videos in the absence of domain-matched training data remains a challenging problem. 
In TV shows and movies, we need to robustly identify the characters in the presence of multiple "visual distractors" such as changes in appearance, background imagery, facial expression, size (resolution), view points (pose), illumination, partial detection (occlusion), and in some cases, age.

  <p><strong>Our idea to mine weakly labeled face tracks</strong><br />
We use self-supervised methods to harvest movie face tracks by exploiting temporally co-occurring faces in a video. Faces that belong to the same track are segmented into ‘tracklets’ that are used as positive samples. Faces from co-occurring tracks are used as hard-negatives.</p>

<p>We showed that adapting pre-trained face embeddings using the weakly labeled faces improve over face verification and face clustering perfrmance in movies. Please see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11289">preprint paper</a> for more details on experiments and results.</p>
