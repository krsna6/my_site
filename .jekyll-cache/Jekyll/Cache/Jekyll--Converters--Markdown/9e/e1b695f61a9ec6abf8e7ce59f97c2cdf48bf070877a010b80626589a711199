worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />

institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />

    <p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>

attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />
the Derivative Works; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Work includes a ‚ÄúNOTICE‚Äù text file as part of its<br />
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />

within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />
as modifying the License.</p>

    <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="5-submission-of-contributions">5. Submission of Contributions</h3>
<p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<h3 id="6-trademarks">6. Trademarks</h3>
<p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

<h3 id="7-disclaimer-of-warranty">7. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
<p>Unless required by applicable law or<br />
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù BASIS,<br />
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>

negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br />
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<h3 id="9-accepting-warranty-or-additional-liability">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</h3>
<p>While redistributing<br />
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>
