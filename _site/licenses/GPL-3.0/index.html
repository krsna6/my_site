  <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a></p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br />
license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br />
software and other kinds of works.</p>

<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,<br />
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom<br />
to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains<br />
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use<br />
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies<br />
also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply<br />
it to your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br />
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you<br />
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the<br />
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom<br />
of others.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br />
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive<br />
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they<br />
know their rights.</p>

<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br />
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br />
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

<p>For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains<br />
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and<br />
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br />
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br />
authors of previous versions.</p>

<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br />
modified versions of the software inside them, although the<br />
manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the<br />
aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The<br />
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for<br />
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.<br />
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the<br />
practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in<br />
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those<br />
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the<br />
freedom of users.</p>

<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br />
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br />
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish<br />
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program<br />
could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL<br />
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />
modification follow.</p>

<h2 id="terms-and-conditions">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>

<h3 id="0-definitions">0. Definitions</h3>

<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds<br />
of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br />
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and<br />
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>

<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of<br />
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of<br />
the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>

<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br />
on the Program.</p>

<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br />
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,<br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br />
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user<br />
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not<br />
conveying.</p>

<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to<br />
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If<br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

<h3 id="1-source-code">1. Source Code</h3>

<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />
making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of<br />
a work.</p>

<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other<br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A<br />
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all<br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br />
control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s<br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br />
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can<br />
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same<br />
work.</p>

<h3 id="2-basic-permissions">2. Basic Permissions</h3>

<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br />
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br />
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a<br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br />
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your<br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,<br />
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.<br />
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having<br />
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with<br />
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the<br />
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br />
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for<br />
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and<br />
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your<br />
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the<br />
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes<br />
it unnecessary.</p>

<h3 id="3-protecting-users-legal-rights-from-anti-circumvention-law">3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law</h3>

<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br />
measures.</p>

<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such<br />
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with<br />
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit<br />
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against<br />
the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid<br />
circumvention of technological measures.</p>

<h3 id="4-conveying-verbatim-copies">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies</h3>

<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you<br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

<h3 id="5-conveying-modified-source-versions">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions</h3>

<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these<br />
conditions:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
  <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br />
it, and giving a relevant date.</li>
  <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br />
released under this License and any conditions added under<br />
section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4<br />
to “keep intact all notices”.</li>
  <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br />
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This<br />
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br />
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br />
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no<br />
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br />
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>
  <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br />
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br />
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br />
work need not make them do so.</li>
</ol>

<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br />
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users<br />
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work<br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br />
parts of the aggregate.</p>

<h3 id="6-conveying-non-source-forms">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms</h3>

<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of<br />
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable<br />
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these<br />
ways:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
  <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br />
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br />
customarily used for software interchange.</li>
  <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br />
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br />
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br />
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br />
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br />
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br />
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br />
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br />
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br />
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding<br />
Source from a network server at no charge.</li>
  <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br />
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This<br />
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br />
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br />
with subsection 6b.</li>
  <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br />
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br />
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br />
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the<br />
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to<br />
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br />
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br />
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br />
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br />
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the<br />
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br />
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>
  <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,<br />
provided you inform other peers where the object code and<br />
Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general<br />
public at no charge under subsection 6d.</li>
</ol>

<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br />
included in conveying the object code work.</p>

<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any<br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,<br />
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for<br />
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a<br />
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of<br />
coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,<br />
“normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of<br />
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br />
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected<br />
to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of<br />
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or<br />
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant<br />
mode of use of the product.</p>

<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to<br />
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User<br />
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The<br />
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of<br />
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br />
solely because modification has been made.</p>

<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br />
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply<br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br />
been installed in ROM).</p>

<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or<br />
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the<br />
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or<br />
installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification<br />
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network<br />
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the<br />
network.</p>

<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br />
unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

<h3 id="7-additional-terms">7. Additional Terms</h3>

<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br />
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions<br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br />
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place<br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders<br />
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
  <li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br />
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
  <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br />
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br />
Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>
  <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,<br />
or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br />
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>
  <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors<br />
or authors of the material; or</li>
  <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br />
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
  <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br />
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions<br />
of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,<br />
for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly<br />
impose on those licensors and authors.</li>
</ol>

<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further<br />
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you<br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br />
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains<br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br />
where to find the applicable terms.</p>

<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the<br />
above requirements apply either way.</p>

<h3 id="8-termination">8. Termination</h3>

<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br />
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br />
paragraph of section 11).</p>

<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license<br />
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,<br />
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally<br />
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder<br />
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to<br />
60 days after the cessation.</p>

<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br />
your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br />
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br />
material under section 10.</p>

<h3 id="9-acceptance-not-required-for-having-copies">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies</h3>

<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run<br />
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,<br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br />
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do<br />
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

<h3 id="10-automatic-licensing-of-downstream-recipients">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients</h3>

<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br />
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible<br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br />
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered<br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br />
licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could<br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may<br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

<h3 id="11-patents">11. Patents</h3>

<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The<br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.</p>

<p>A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned<br />
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br />
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br />
this License.</p>

<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br />
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to<br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br />
sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a<br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br />
patent against the party.</p>

<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br />
license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have<br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work<br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br />
work and works based on it.</p>

<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the<br />
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on<br />
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically<br />
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you<br />
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the<br />
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the<br />
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the<br />
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties<br />
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent<br />
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by<br />
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in<br />
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the<br />
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent<br />
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

<h3 id="12-no-surrender-of-others-freedom">12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom</h3>

<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a<br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under<br />
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a<br />
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to<br />
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying<br />
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could<br />
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely<br />
from conveying the Program.</p>

<h3 id="13-use-with-the-gnu-affero-general-public-license">13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br />
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this<br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br />
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br />
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br />
combination as such.</p>

<h3 id="14-revised-versions-of-this-license">14. Revised Versions of this License</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />
of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions<br />
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in<br />
detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br />
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public<br />
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of<br />
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or<br />
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the<br />
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public<br />
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free<br />
Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions<br />
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public<br />
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to<br />
choose that version for the Program.</p>

<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different<br />
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br />
later version.</p>

<h3 id="15-disclaimer-of-warranty">15. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>

<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br />
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT<br />
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT<br />
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR<br />
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br />
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE<br />
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR<br />
CORRECTION.</p>

<h3 id="16-limitation-of-liability">16. Limitation of Liability</h3>

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR<br />
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br />
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br />
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT<br />
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR<br />
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM<br />
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER<br />
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<h3 id="17-interpretation-of-sections-15-and-16">17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16</h3>

<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
